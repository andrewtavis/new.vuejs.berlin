Our meetups take place monthly every second Tuesday at 19:00. If there are talks, they usually begin 19:30, right after we ate some pizza and had some drinks. Depending on our host we might also [stream](https://www.instagram.com/vuejs_berlin/) and [record](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClSmiKom-8XsWbi5NTWurjg) the talks. Records are then usually available one or two days after the meetup.
