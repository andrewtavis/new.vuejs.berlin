Hey Vuers,

Very warm welcome in 2020.

This year we want to continue enhancing our meetup and we are preparing some thing that you will, hopefully, like.

First news for this year is that we created our Discord group and everyone can join it here:

[discord.gg/8RBvVk](https://discord.gg/8RBvVk)

We can discuss there new interesting topics, propose talks or speakers, help you with your code or find interesting conferences.

Thank you

And see you on our Discord.

Jiri & Norman
