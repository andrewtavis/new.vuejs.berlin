Hey Vuers,

After a break in October we are back with meetups. Our next meetup is scheduled to 14th November at Wunderdog offices.

If you are interested to have a talk let us know. We have still open slots for any Vue.js related talk.

Also thanks to our meetup partner JetBrains we will give away three free yearly licences for their IDEs of your choice.

And lastly don&rsquo;t make plans for the weekend of 4-5 November because it is an all-you-can-watch weekend at Vue School. For two full days, they unlock all 54 of their highly acclaimed courses and make them available to you completely FREE.

It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you are a beginner or advanced developer - you can utilize this opportunity to improve your Vue coding skills by learning best practices and new tools and techniques, avoiding common gotchas, maximizing performance, and shipping fewer bugs!

This is your chance to check out new platforms, libraries, or technologies like Pinia, Nuxt, Astro, Laravel, Vite, Vitest, VueUse, Typescript, ChatGPT, Chart.js, Jamstack, Sentry, Visual Studio Code, Formkit, GraphQL and so much more&hellip;

With more than 1,040 lessons available, make sure you sign up now!

Reserve your spot at https://vue.school/fw-vuejsberlin


Have a nice November and see you soon.

Jiri and Norman
