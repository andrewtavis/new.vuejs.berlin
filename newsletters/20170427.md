Hi Vue'sers,

Ancuta from JSHeroes came to be to tell me about their conference and asked me to send a 20% discount voucher around for those who want to visit the conference.

The line-up looks very nice and Cluj is definitely worth a visit (source: Wikipedia).

Everyone who wants to purchase an early bird ticket for 79€ instead of 99€, please write me and I will send you a link (attention: the default "answer to" is set to the mailing list address, not mine).

Have an awesome week!
