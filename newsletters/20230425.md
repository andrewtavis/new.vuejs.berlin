Let's forge software together!

➡️ WHAT IS IT ABOUT?

Vue.js Forge is a hands-on event on 3rd and 4th of May, that will upgrade your skill set to becoming a Vue.js expert! If you already are a Vue.js pro, this event is a chance to test your skills and help young developers to grow!

We will form one or more groups to work on this year's Vue.js Forge project. This is the third iteration of the conference; former projects have been a full e-commerce site and a kanban board ("Trello"). This year's project has still to be revealed.


➡️ WHY SHOULD I ATTEND?

This event will get you valuable experience working as part of a development team, extending your development experience by drawing directly from the experience of others. Discover alternate approaches, uncover new tools, directly access the knowledge of experienced team mentors.


➡️ WHAT DO I NEED?

Any level of experience is welcome; from people totally new to Vue.js or web development to experienced senior developers. All you need to bring is a laptop to work with and time on both days. We will offer the space, internet connection and help if needed.
