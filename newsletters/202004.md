Hello lovely people,

TechLabs Berlin is offering a free tech bootcamp and inviting everyone to check it out.

It is a totally free coding-bootcamp for motivated individuals who wish to learn how to
code in only 16 weeks with their own e-learning platform and video-calls with mentors
and other engaged students. They aim for three distinctive goals:

1. Effective Learning
2. Learning at scale without boundaries
3. Connecting People.

And they have four learning paths: UXDesign, WebDev, Data Science and AI.

Everything completely remote!

The application deadline is 17th of April! So check it out right now!

I cannot send any attachments here as it seems so I'll just link a one-page document with all the details again: https://drive.google.com/file/d/15kVuYJVf9nb1OUZ7GH4ws440oP2zGOy9/view

You can of course also directly jump to their pre-registering page: https://bit.ly/3bNz0NH

I hope you're all keeping up in these strange times. Stay positive!
