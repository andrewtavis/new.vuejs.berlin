Dear Vue'sers,

Foremost: please accept my apologies for the chaotic times, the event interruptions and the uncertainty. So lets better start with the good news:

**We found a new place!**

Thanks to Andrew and Alice from Wikimedia, we will be hosted in their Event space from now on. Stay tuned for more details, but safely put a mark in your calendar for next Tuesday (9th of July)!

Now to the other news&hellip;

Meetup changed the pricing model, and unexpectedly tripled(!) the prices for the Standard plan. You can read more about it on their blog: [meetup.com/blog/new-organizer-pricing-key-improvements](https://meetup.com/blog/new-organizer-pricing-key-improvements).

The pricing change is, in my opinion, by no means justified. I'm currently exploring alternative platforms that meet our needs while remaining cost-effective. If you have any suggestions for meeting management tools or platforms you've had positive experiences with, please feel free to share them. I'll keep everyone updated on our progress in finding a new solution.

Thank you. Your patience and understanding is highly appreciated.


Regards

Norman from Vuejs//Berlin
