Today is the first Vuejs//Berlin meetup of the year and we have some tasty treats for you!

## Three talks are waiting for you!

 *  Jakub will talk about **Taproot - How Ecosia built their own web app framework, and why you should, too!**
 *  Romuald & Aurelien will have a lightning talk about **Vike - Like Nuxt, but as do-one-thing-do-it-well Vite plugin**
 *  Last but not least, Kailaash gives us **an introduction into Card Sorting**

You can find more details on [the event page](https://vuejs.berlin/events/2024-01-09-vuejs-berlin-new-years-edition.html).

## The usual goodies

Of course, there will be Drinks and Pizza, as well as a cute dog.
