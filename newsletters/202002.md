Hello Vuesers!

On our last meetup, Honeypot showed us a teaser of their upcoming Vuejs Documentary and they will show the full Documentary for the first time at Vuejs Amsterdam.

But if you cannot make it to Amsterdam or simply want to see it again, we have great news! Honeypot invited the whole Vuejs Berlin community to come to their Office for the Berlin release party on 24th of February!

Check out their event on:

Â­I'm looking forward to meet all of you there!


Greetings from Amsterdam

Norman
