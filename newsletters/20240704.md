Dear Vue'sers,

Following our recent update, we have an important announcement:

<div class="alert">We're Moving to Luma!</div>

Due to Meetup.com's pricing changes, we're transitioning to Luma for event management.
Please subscribe there for future events and newsletters:

**[lu.ma/vuejs_berlin](https://lu.ma/vuejs_berlin)**

This move ensures, that we can continue providing free, community-driven events.

Further key updates:

1. As mentioned previously, our new venue is:

    Wikimedia Deutschland e.V.<br/>
    Tempelhofer Ufer 23-24<br/>
    10963 Berlin

2. Additional Resources:
    * Our website ([vuejs.berlin](https://vuejs.berlin)) always displays the latest events and newsletter archive.
    * The site is open-source, and contributions are welcome. Check out [github.com/VuejsBerlin](https://github.com/VuejsBerlin/new.vuejs.berlin)

We appreciate your understanding and continued support as we make this transition.
